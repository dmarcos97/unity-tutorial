# unity-tutorial

This repository includes several example scenes to introduce you to coding in Unity. The content of each example is as follows:

* Example 1 - Void: This scene does not contain any GameObject or special script, but a template. It is intended to introduce to the general Unity environment, as well as the main structure of Unity scripts.
* Example 2 - Object Handling: This scene contains some examples of how to handle GameObjects by script and how to interact through GUI. The GameManager.cs script controls the movement of a sphere, while the ButtonBehaviour.cs script controls when the GUI button is pressed and increases the displayed text.
* Example 3 - Animations: This scene shows how to provide animation to a character.
